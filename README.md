💖 Habibi App

Welcome to Habibi — a lovingly crafted mobile app I made as a gift for someone very special to me."Habibi" is what we lovingly call each other, and this app is my little way of showing love, care, and fun through code.

Note: This is an ongoing project, and I'm still actively working on it. I'm always thinking of new features and ways to improve it for her.

This Flutter project brings together a few simple but meaningful things I thought she might enjoy — to entertain her, support her, and remind her how much she means to me.

✨ Features

The home screen has a soft pink theme and displays five rounded buttons. Each one opens up something special I made just for her:

❤️ Heart Icon

This shows a heartfelt message I wrote — something sweet she can read anytime she wants a little pick-me-up.

📝 Note Icon

A cozy little notepad where she can write down thoughts, reminders, or anything that comes to mind.

📅 Calendar Icon

A lightweight calendar with a built-in period and pregnancy tracker — something simple but hopefully useful for her.

😊 Smiley Icon (Magic Eight Ball)

A fun Magic Eight Ball that gives randomized, playful answers. Just something silly we can laugh at together.

🎮 Game Icon (coming soon)

This will be a simple 2D game she can play for fun when she wants to relax.

Below the icons, I added a photo of us and a quote in Tagalog — just a little extra touch to make the screen feel even more personal and warm.

👫 Together Page

This page celebrates our relationship by showing a live counter of how long we've been together — in days, hours, and minutes. It updates automatically based on the current time on her phone.

It also includes another photo of us and a short message I added to make the space feel extra cozy and meaningful.

❤️ Purpose

This app isn’t just about features — it’s a love letter in app form. Everything in here is something I made with her in mind. I wanted to create something that could entertain her, support her, and always remind her how much I love and appreciate her.
